# Academic_Performance_Prediction


As education has become more ubiquitous over the years, the diversity of students has exploded
in numerous aspects. This being the case, one of the most prevalent concerns within education is
that of educational equity; i.e. how do we ensure that students are receiving the tools, resources,
and attention necessary to perform on the same level as their peers? One of the most pressing
problems in search of a solution with regards to educational equity is that of identifying which
students need support in the first place. Our goal in this paper will be to analyze the use of various
statistical methods to develop models for the prediction of grades as a means of identifying in-need
students.
